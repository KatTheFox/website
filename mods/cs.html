      <ul>
        <li>
          Secret Histories Ink: Adds a Secret Histories pigment, so you can
          paint the Teresa and Christopher painting without console.
        </li>
        <li>
          Looping Recruitment: Simple mod to let you automatically search for
          acquaintances and patrons until the decks are empty. Start looping by
          putting 2 lore fragments in the talk verb, and if you need to stop put
          a health into the slot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improved Skintwisters: Makes Skintwisters have a 90% chance to destroy
          evidence, the same as every other Exalt's success chance at their job,
          instead of 70%, the same as a disciple. Made to replace an old mod
          that was less balanced.
        </li>
        <li>
          Looping Mansus: Loop your trips to the mansus. Inspired by the Looping
          Job mod. The Peacock's Door can only be looped with the Frangiclave,
          since it breaks mirrors, and the Spider's Door cannot be looped at
          all, as it consumes its offerings.
        </li>
        <li>
          On Matthias and the Amethyst Imago: Loss: Adds a loss sigil to the
          cover of the book, On Matthias and the Amethyst Imago: Loss. Joke mod.

      <h4 id="history">A Brief Mod History</h4>
      <p>
        Back in July 2022, I completed a small mobile card game called
        Underhand. It's still available on the Play Store, and was apparently a
        college project for a trio of developers. I loved it, and searched to
        see if the developers had done anything else; I found a published email
        from the developers stating that they weren't working together anymore,
        but anyone who wanted more Underhand should look into the game that
        inspired it, 'Cultist Simulator'. I downloaded it and immediately was
        fascinated by the deceptively deep lore hiding inside what was
        technically a game about moving cards around on a tabletop.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn't long before I discovered the game had modding support, and
        started tinkering with the game files. After scrapping several ideas
        that never went anywhere, I published my first mod, "Looping Mansus",
        which just let you automate a certain part of the game that gets
        repetitive quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few months later, another modder published a mod that allowed you to
        define custom board layouts and auto-snap cards to these "shelves",
        using a surprisingly complex "expression" system (which is technically
        part of another mod, The Roost Machine). This made it much easier for me
        to play the game, and I quickly set up a generator to make custom shelf
        layouts reasonably easily, and published a mod with my own layouts.
        Apparently, my layouts were sensible, since the mod (at the time simply
        titled "Kat's Shelves") was fairly popular- although the fact that it
        was one of the first mods of its kind almost certainly helped.

        My first foray into "dll modding" (Cultsim allows both content-only json
        mods and C# patch mods using Harmony) came when one of the mods I'd been
        using, "Adjustable Fast Forward" (which does exactly what it says)
        broke. The author didn't seem intent on maintaining it (and to this day,
        it has not been fixed) so I decided I'd just make my own. Within a few
        hours, I had a mod that did exactly what the original did, but after
        publishing it I received several feature requests from community members
        and had more ideas of my own, and it grew to become a must-have
        time-control mod with many features. Today, The Wheel has 1407 total
        unique subscribers on the Steam Workshop (and is also available on
        github, for non-steam players)
      </p>
      <p>
        After seeing the relative ease with which The Wheel was born, I decided
        to make an ambitious joke mod. I'd previously made a script to run the
        game's content through an uwu text transformer, but that was inefficient
        and required pregeneration. After a bit of tinkering, A Tewwibwe Cuwse
        2.0 was born, a dll mod that intercepts the game's content loading
        process to run the transformer on all text- including mods. Notably,
        this includes the in-game patch notes, credits, and title screen, which
        has led to some entertaining results.

      >
      <p>
        As I played more and more content mods, I realized that it was becoming
        a pain to play these mods without the shelves I'd come to rely on, and
        decided it was time for a revamp of my shelves mod. I added new shelves
        for all the DLC and content mods I'd played, and made greater use of
        complex expressions to make shelves that pushed the limits of the system
        (sometimes literally- back then the Shelves mod wasn't very
        well-optimized, so autosorting would cause stutter if there were too
        many complex expressions). I also rebranded it, in the long tradition of
        naming mods after lore concepts, to Hawthorn. Nowadays, Hawthorn
        includes shelves for 9 major content mods, as well as all DLCs, vanilla
        layouts, and compatibility with minor mods.
