      <h2 style="margin-top: 7px">(working title)</h2>
      <hr />
      <h2 id="what">What is that</h2>
      <p>
        AWBETLFAB (title subject to change) is an upcoming
        research/argumentative paper I'm working on regarding the detrimental
        effects of heirarchical social structures on those forced to endure
        them. The thesis is that heirarchical society is inherently harmful and
        should be replaced. The current working title is based on a line from
        'Stress: Portrait of a Killer' in which a researcher implies that we
        should kill the people upholding the current society.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2 id="how">How are you going to argue that in like a week</h2>
      While, yes, a full argument against society as most people today know it
      would be out of scope for this project, I believe I can focus on a smaller
      section of the issue- namely, the harmful effects surrounding mental
      health. This does mean I will likely not spend much time covering
      <i>alternatives</i> to the current state of affairs; further research is
      left as a heavily recommended exercise for the reader (seriously, do some
      research on the topic, it's a very interesting field. Just don't get
      involved with ancaps they're idiots). Thus, the scope I'm setting for this
      paper is 'the negative effects of the current societal structure on mental
      health, and evidence that it can change in a positive direction.'
      <hr />
      <h2 id="source">
        Nice argument. Why don't you back it up with a source?
      </h2>
      Certainly. While all this is subject to change, here's an overview of my
      current sources.<br />
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">

        This source is probably my favorite, the authors noticed that global
        polls such as the World Happiness Report exclude "small-scale,
        nonindustrialized societies" so they decided to study whether the
        generally accepted correlation of "higher average income corresponds to
        higher average happiness" applied to these communities. And what they
        found, of course, was that not only is that not true, but that these
        communities display "high average levels of life satisfaction,
        comparable to those of wealthy countries" despite having "very low
        monetary incomes." This evidence not only contradicts common assumption
        but does so in a way that highlights that not only is the status quo not
        the only option, it's absolutely not the best option.

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">Stress: Portrait of a Killer</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: 3px">Heminway, John.</p>
      <p>
        This film is a documentary about the effects of stress; it's also one of
        the required sources. Much of the documentary follows a team of
        researchers studying the causes and effects of stress within a tribe of
        baboons. At the end of the documentary, it's revealed that the baboons
        whose heirarchy was causing stress-related health issues had a tragic
        accident wherein all the 'dominant males' of the tribe died; from then
        on, researchers observed that not only was their society completely
        restructured in a positive way (all the baboons were much "nicer") but
        that their stress and illness levels dropped drastically, and further
        baboons who joined the tribe quickly learned the new order and
        integrated with it. After this, the researcher asks "Are we brave enough
        to learn from a baboon?", implying that a similar event (presumably an
        armed revolution) needs to happen to humanity, which I liked enough that
        it became the title of this paper.

        In this work, data from "10 waves of a major UK longitudinal household
        cohort study" is analysed "to examine the relationship between income
        and anxiety and depression among 16- to 24-year-olds." The results are
        unsurprising, with lower-income households consistently producing higher
        levels of depression and anxiety.

        This study is much the same as the prior work, except this one is
        US-based and also takes into account the levels of income inequality in
        the state. The results are, again, unsurprising, with both low household
        income and average state income inequality being linked to mental health
        issues.

        This one is fairly similar to the previous two again, except this time
        it focuses on the mental health of children in low-income households-
        which, while once again unsurprising, raises an important concern,
        namely, that such circumstances are self-propagating, with those who
        grew up poor staying poor and causing further mental health issues for
        their children in a vicious positive feedback loop.

        Another of the required sources. The message here is primarily that
        people are resistant to change when they shouldn't be, and that just
        because a solution isn't guaranteed to work doesn't mean it shouldn't be
        attempted, fairly standard call to action material. I'm using it here
        primarily because I know that people will tend to read my paper and
        think "wow this person's an idiot look at how stable the current
        capitalist system is, causing unrest and instability is just causing
        suffering for no assured reward" with zero self-reflection or cognizance
        of how absolutely moronic that sentence is. If you are that person:
        congratulations, you're an idiot.

      <h2 id="issues">Have you had any issues with this so far?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, actually, plenty. I know the sheer quality of my work and my
        eloquent arguments in class discussion project an image of effortless
        erudition (and for the most part that's true), but I actually spend
        quite a lot of effort to produce work that meets my impossible standards
        (which I of course generally fail). In this case, I'm aware of several
        glaring issues with my current concept- the lack of unique supporting
        points and the redundance of my sources are the two most obvious. In
        fact, until this morning I was working on a paper with an entirely
        different thesis! I'll make it work, of course, but it's genuinely
        difficult to write 7-10 pages on something I percieve to be so blatantly
        obvious. Although, that being said, I'm well aware that once I start
        actually fleshing out the paper it'll probably end up around 15-20
        pages- sorry, that always just happens.
      </p>

        Looks like it. If any of you have any questions for me, now's the time
        to ask them, but I assume you're all tired and bored so I'm going to
        stop talking now. Thanks for enduring my overly-long monologue. If you
        have any questions for me feel free to ask, otherwise I'm done here.
