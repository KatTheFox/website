      <h3>(working title)</h3>
      <hr />
      <h3 id="what">What is that</h3>
      <p>
        AWBETLFAB (title subject to change) is an upcoming
        research/argumentative paper I'm working on regarding the detrimental
        effects of heirarchical social structures on those forced to endure
        them. The thesis is that heirarchical society is inherently harmful and
        should be replaced. The current working title is based on a line from
        'Stress: Portrait of a Killer' in which a researcher implies that we
        should kill the people upholding the current society.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3 id="how">How are you going to argue that in like a week</h3>
      While, yes, a full argument against society as most people today know it
      would be out of scope for this project, I believe I can focus on a smaller
      section of the issue- namely, the harmful effects surrounding mental
      health. This does mean I will likely not spend much time covering
      <i>alternatives</i> to the current state of affairs; further research is
      left as a heavily recommended exercise for the reader (seriously, do some
      research on the topic, it's a very interesting field. Just don't get
      involved with ancaps they're idiots). Thus, the scope I'm setting for this
      paper is 'the negative effects of the current societal structure on mental
      health, and evidence that it can change in a positive direction.'
      <hr />
      <h3 id="source">
        Nice argument. Why don't you back it up with a source?
      </h3>
      Certainly. While all this is subject to change, here's an overview of my
      current sources.<br />
